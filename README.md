# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

This project was created as a solution for the Module 1 challenge of our coursework. This challenge exposed me to:

- Refactoring css in order to reduce redundant / overly complex declarative blocks. Things should only be as specific as needed.
- Understanding the importance of semantic tags for SEOs.
- Knowing which decorators to leverage in order to reduce complexity and future work for subsequent front-end devs.
- Forming an inclusive mindset as a developer in order to better serve webpage visitors that have special needs or those that come from diverse backgrounds.
- style.css files can probably get a little crazy with larger webpages (if the files themselves aren't )
